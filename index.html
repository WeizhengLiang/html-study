    <h3>intro:</h3>
    <p> <strong>Santa Claus</strong>, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, or simply Santa, is a
        legendary[1] character originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts on Christmas Eve of
        toys and candy to well-behaved children,[2] and either coal or nothing to naughty children. <br />

        He is said to accomplish this with the aid of Christmas elves, who make the toys in his workshop at the North
        Pole, and flying
        reindeer who pull his sleigh through the air.</p>

        <p>The modern character of Santa Claus was based on traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas (a
        fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver of Myra), the English figure of Father Christmas, and the Dutch
        figure of Sinterklaas (also based on Saint Nicholas).
